Keras tutorial: How to run on IPU
-----------------------------------

This tutorial provides an introduction on how to run Keras models on IPUs, and features that allow you to fully utilise the capability of the IPU. Please refer to the [TensorFlow 2 documentation - Keras with IPUs](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/tensorflow-user-guide/en/latest/keras_tf2.html) and the TensorFlow 2 Keras API reference sections on [IPU extensions](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/tensorflow-user-guide/en/latest/api.html#module-tensorflow.python.ipu.keras.extensions), and IPU-specific [Keras layers](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/tensorflow-user-guide/en/latest/api.html#keras-layers), [Keras losses](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/tensorflow-user-guide/en/latest/api.html#module-tensorflow.python.ipu.keras.losses) and [Keras optimizers](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/tensorflow-user-guide/en/latest/api.html#module-tensorflow.python.ipu.keras.optimizers) for full details of all available features.

Refer to the Getting Started with Spell guide for your IPU System for instructions.

#### Keras MNIST example


The script `mnist_cpu.py` illustrates a simple example using the MNIST numeral dataset, which consists of 60,000 images for training and 10,000 images for testing. The images are of handwritten digits 0-9, and they must be classified according to which digit they represent. MNIST classification is a toy example problem, but is sufficient to outline the concepts introduced in this tutorial.

Without changes, `mnist_cpu.py` will run the Keras model on the CPU. It is based on the original Keras tutorial and as such is vanilla Keras code. You can run this now to see its output. In the following sections, we will go through the changes needed to make this run on the IPU.

Run:

```
spell run --machine-type IPUx16 --docker-image graphcore/tensorflow:latest 'python3 mnist_cpu.py'
```

Your output should be:

```
Epoch 1/3
938/938 [==============================] - 10s 10ms/step - loss: 1.6732 - accuracy: 0.4536
Epoch 2/3
938/938 [==============================] - 9s 10ms/step - loss: 0.3618 - accuracy: 0.8890
Epoch 3/3
938/938 [==============================] - 9s 10ms/step - loss: 0.2376 - accuracy: 0.9289
```

#### Completed example

The folder `completed_example` contains a complete implementation of the illustrated Keras model which is more easily configured than the scripts in the `completed_demos` directory. This has been provided for you to experiment with. Run `python3 completed_example/main.py` to run the standard Keras model on a CPU.

The `--use-ipu` and `--pipelining` flags allow you to run the Keras model on the IPU and (optionally) adopt the pipelining feature respectively. The gradient accumulation count can be adjusted with the `--gradient-accumulation-count` flag.

Note that the code in `completed_example` has been refactored into 3 parts:

* `main.py`: Main code to be run.

* `model.py`: Implementation of a standard Keras model and a pipelined Keras model.

* `utils.py`: Contains functions that load the data and argument parser.

Directly run the example on Spell:

```
spell run --machine-type IPUx16 --docker-image graphcore/tensorflow:latest 'python3 completed_example/main.py'
```

#### Running the example on the IPU

In this section, we will make a series of edits to `mnist_cpu.py` in order to train the model using the IPU. Make a copy of `mnist_cpu.py` to follow along.

##### 1. Import the TensorFlow IPU module

First, we import the TensorFlow IPU module.

Add the following import statement to the beginning of your script:

```python
from tensorflow.python import ipu
```

For the `ipu` module to function properly, we must import it directly rather than accessing it through the top-level TensorFlow module.

##### 2. Preparing the dataset

Some extra care must be taken when preparing a dataset for training a Keras model on the IPU. The Poplar software stack does not support using tensors with shapes which are not known when the model is compiled, so we must make sure the sizes of our datasets are divisible by the batch size. Add the following code just after the point where the dataset is loaded:

```python
def make_divisible(number, divisor):
    return number - number % divisor

# Adjust dataset lengths to be divisible by the batch size
train_data_len = x_train.shape[0]
train_data_len = make_divisible(train_data_len, batch_size)
x_train, y_train = x_train[:train_data_len], y_train[:train_data_len]

test_data_len = x_test.shape[0]
test_data_len = make_divisible(test_data_len, batch_size)
x_test, y_test = x_test[:test_data_len], y_test[:test_data_len]
```

We introduce a utility function, `make_divisible`, which computes the largest number, no larger than a given number, which is divisible by a given divisor. This will be of further use later.

With a batch size of 64, we lose 32 training examples and 48 evaluation examples, which is less than 0.2% of each dataset.

There are other ways to prepare a dataset for training on the IPU. You can create a `tf.data.Dataset` object using your data, then use its `.repeat()` method to create a looped version of the dataset. If you do not want to lose any data, you can pad the datasets with tensors of zeros, then set `sample_weight` to be a vector of 1’s and 0’s according to which values are real so the extra values don’t affect the training process (though this may be slower than using the other methods).

##### 3. Add IPU configuration

To use the IPU, you must create an IPU session configuration.

Add the following code after the model function definition in `mnist_cpu.py`:

```python
ipu_config = ipu.config.IPUConfig()
ipu_config.auto_select_ipus = 1
ipu_config.configure_ipu_system()
```

This is all we need to get a small model up and running, though a full list of configuration options is available in the [API documentation](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/tensorflow-user-guide/en/latest/api.html#tensorflow.python.ipu.config.IPUConfig).


##### 4. Specify IPU strategy

Next, add the following code after the configuration:

```python
# Create an execution strategy.
strategy = ipu.ipu_strategy.IPUStrategy()
```

The `tf.distribute.Strategy` is an API to distribute training across multiple devices. `IPUStrategy` is a subclass which targets a system with one or more IPUs attached. Another subclass, [IPUMultiWorkerStrategy](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/tensorflow-user-guide/en/latest/api.html#tensorflow.python.ipu.ipu_multi_worker_strategy.IPUMultiWorkerStrategy), targets a multi-system configuration.

##### 5. Wrap the model within the IPU strategy scope

Creating variables and Keras models within the scope of the `IPUStrategy` object will ensure that they are placed on the IPU. To do this, we create a `strategy.scope()` context manager and move all the model code inside it:

```python
with strategy.scope():
    # Model.__init__ takes two required arguments, inputs and outputs.
    model = keras.Model(*model_fn())

    # Compile our model with Stochastic Gradient Descent as an optimizer
    # and Categorical Cross Entropy as a loss.
    model.compile('sgd', 'categorical_crossentropy', metrics=["accuracy"])

    model.summary()
    print('\nTraining')
    model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=3, batch_size=64)
    print('\nEvaluation')
    model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
```

Note that the function `model_fn()` defined in `mnist_cpu.py` can be readily reused, and all we really need to do is move the code inside the context of `strategy.scope()`. Prior to the release of version 2.2.0 of the Poplar SDK, it would have been necessary to make the model an instance of the `ipu.keras.Model` class, which has been removed as of version 2.2.0.

While all computation will now be performed on the IPU, the initialisation of variables will still be performed on the host.


##### 6. Results

Running the code now gives the following throughput values for training:

```
937/937 [==============================] - 45s 3ms/step - loss: 1.5260 - accuracy: 0.4949
Epoch 2/3
937/937 [==============================] - 2s 3ms/step - loss: 0.3412 - accuracy: 0.8968
Epoch 3/3
937/937 [==============================] - 3s 3ms/step - loss: 0.2358 - accuracy: 0.9294
```

The training time has been significantly reduced by use of the IPU. We ignore the reported total for the first epoch because this time includes the model's compilation time.

>To avoid recompiling the same code every time a TensorFlow process is started, you can [turn on caching of the executable](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/tensorflow-user-guide/en/latest/compiling.html#compiling-and-pre-compiling-executables).

The file `completed_demos/completed_demo_ipu.py` shows what the code looks like after the above changes are made. If your code  is not working, you may find it useful to compare your code to that in `completed_demos/completed_demo_ipu.py`.

#### Going faster by setting `steps_per_execution`

The IPU implementation above is fast, but not as fast as it could be. This is because, unless we specify otherwise, the program that runs on the IPU will only process a single batch, so we cannot get a speedup from loading the data asynchronously and using a looped version of this program.

To change this, we must set the `steps_per_execution` argument in `model.compile()`. This sets the number of batches processed  in each execution of the underlying IPU program. Make a copy of `completed_demos/completed_demo_ipu.py`, and change the code for adjusting the lengths of the datasets to the following:

```python
# Adjust dataset lengths to be divisible by the batch size
train_data_len = x_train.shape[0]
train_steps_per_execution = train_data_len // batch_size
train_data_len = make_divisible(train_data_len, train_steps_per_execution * batch_size)
x_train, y_train = x_train[:train_data_len], y_train[:train_data_len]

test_data_len = x_test.shape[0]
test_steps_per_execution = test_data_len // batch_size
test_data_len = make_divisible(test_data_len, test_steps_per_execution * batch_size)
x_test, y_test = x_test[:test_data_len], y_test[:test_data_len]
```

The number of examples in the dataset must be divisible by the number of examples processed per execution (that is, `steps_per_execution * batch_size`). Here, we set `steps_per_execution` to be `(length of dataset) // batch_size` for maximum throughput and so that we do not lose any more data than we have to, though this code should work just as well with a different, smaller value.

Now we update the code from `with strategy.scope():` onwards by passing `steps_per_execution` as an argument to `model.compile()`, and providing our `batch_size` value to `model.fit()` and `model.evaluate()`. We can re-compile the model with a different value of `steps_per_execution` between running `model.fit()` and `model.evaluate()`, so we do so here, although it isn't compulsory.

```python
with strategy.scope():
    model = keras.Model(*model_fn())

    # Compile our model with Stochastic Gradient Descent as an optimizer
    # and Categorical Cross Entropy as a loss.
    model.compile('sgd', 'categorical_crossentropy',
                  metrics=["accuracy"],
                  steps_per_execution=train_steps_per_execution)
    model.summary()
    print('\nTraining')
    model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=3, batch_size=batch_size)
    model.compile('sgd', 'categorical_crossentropy',
                  metrics=["accuracy"],
                  steps_per_execution=test_steps_per_execution)
    print('\nEvaluation')
    model.evaluate(x_test, y_test, batch_size=batch_size)
```

Running this code, the model trains much faster:

```
937/937 [==============================] - 43s 46ms/step - loss: 1.0042 - accuracy: 0.6783
Epoch 2/3
937/937 [==============================] - 0s 224us/step - loss: 0.3021 - accuracy: 0.9079
Epoch 3/3
937/937 [==============================] - 0s 222us/step - loss: 0.2240 - accuracy: 0.9326
```

The file `completed_demos/completed_demo_faster.py` shows what the code looks like after the above changes are made. If your code for the replicated model is not working, you may find it useful to compare your code to that in `completed_demos/completed_demo_faster.py`.


#### Replication

Another way to speed up the training of a model is to make a copy of the model on each of multiple IPUs, updating the parameters of the model on all IPUs after each forward and backward pass. This is called _replication_, and can be done in Keras with very few code changes. To follow this section, first either make a copy of `completed_demos/completed_demo_faster.py` or your original edited `mnist_cpu.py`.

First, we'll add variables for the number of IPUs and the number of replicas:
```python
# Variables for model hyperparameters
num_classes = 10
input_shape = (28, 28, 1)
batch_size = 64
num_ipus = num_replicas = 2
```

Because our model is written for one IPU, the number of replicas will be equal to the number of IPUs.

We will need to adjust for the fact that with replication, a batch is processed on each replica for each step, so `steps_per_execution` needs to be divisible by the number of replicas. Also, the maximum value of `steps_per_execution` is now `train_data_len // (batch_size * num_replicas)`, since the number of examples processed in each step is now `(batch_size * num_replicas)`. We therefore add two lines to the dataset-adjustment code:

```python
def make_divisible(number, divisor):
    return number - number % divisor

# Adjust dataset lengths to be divisible by the batch size
train_data_len = x_train.shape[0]
train_steps_per_execution = train_data_len // (batch_size * num_replicas)
# `steps_per_execution` needs to be divisible by the number of replicas
train_steps_per_execution = make_divisible(train_steps_per_execution, num_replicas)
train_data_len = make_divisible(train_data_len, train_steps_per_execution * batch_size)
x_train, y_train = x_train[:train_data_len], y_train[:train_data_len]

test_data_len = x_test.shape[0]
test_steps_per_execution = test_data_len // (batch_size * num_replicas)
# `steps_per_execution` needs to be divisible by the number of replicas
test_steps_per_execution = make_divisible(test_steps_per_execution, num_replicas)
test_data_len = make_divisible(test_data_len, test_steps_per_execution * batch_size)
x_test, y_test = x_test[:test_data_len], y_test[:test_data_len]
```

We'll need to acquire multiple IPUs, so we update the configuration step:

```python
ipu_config = ipu.config.IPUConfig()
ipu_config.auto_select_ipus = num_ipus
ipu_config.configure_ipu_system()
```

These are all the changes we need to make to replicate the model and train on multiple IPUs. There is no need to explicitly copy the model or organise the exchange of weight updates between the IPUs because all of these details are handled automatically, as long as we select multiple IPUs and create and use our model within the scope of an `IPUStrategy` object.

With replication, the model trains even faster:

```
936/936 [==============================] - 44s 47ms/step - loss: 1.1886 - accuracy: 0.6213
Epoch 2/3
936/936 [==============================] - 0s 135us/step - loss: 0.3155 - accuracy: 0.9054
Epoch 3/3
936/936 [==============================] - 0s 134us/step - loss: 0.2277 - accuracy: 0.9304
```

However, we do not get a perfect 2x speedup because the gradients must be exchanged between the IPUs before each weight update.

The file `completed_demos/completed_demo_replicated.py` shows what the code looks like after the above changes are made. If your code for the replicated model is not working, you may find it useful to compare your code to that in `completed_demos/completed_demo_replicated.py`.

#### Pipelining

For models that require multiple IPUs, for example due to their size, pipelining can be used to maximise the use of the IPUs involved by executing different parts of the model in parallel. A pipelined model assigns sections (called _stages_) of the model to different IPUs, concurrently processing different mini-batches of data through each stage.

Below, you can see a diagram of the pipelining process on 3 IPUs during training:

![Pipeline time sequence during model training](pipeline_time_seq_training.png)

In order to maximise the utilisation of IPUs during execution of a pipelined model you should aim to increase the time spent in the _main execution phase_.  Pipelining has 3 phases: ramp up, main execution, and ramp down. During the ramp up and down phases not all the IPUs are in use, by increasing the number of mini-batches that are processed before performing a weight update, we increase the amount of time spent in the main execution phase, improving the utilisation of the IPUs and speeding up computation.

One of the key features of the IPU which enables efficient pipelining is [_gradient accumulation_](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/tensorflow-user-guide/en/latest/perf_training.html?highlight=pipelining#id3). With gradient accumulation, instead of updating the weights between each mini-batch, forward and backward passes are performed on several mini-batches, while keeping a cumulative sum of the gradients. A weight update is applied based on this accumulated gradient after the specified number of mini-batches has been processed. This ensures consistency between the weights used in the forward and backward passes while increasing the time spent in the main execution phase. We call the processing of a mini-batch a _gradient accumulation step_, and the number of mini-batches processed between weight updates is the number of gradient accumulation steps.

By processing multiple mini-batches between weight updates, gradient accumulation increases the effective batch size of our training process. With gradient accumulation the _effective_ batch size is the size of the mini-batch multiplied by the number of gradient accumulation steps. This allows us to train models with batch sizes which would not fit directly in the memory of the IPU.

To learn more about about pipelining you may want to read [the relevant section of the Technical Note on Model Parallelism in TensorFlow](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/tf-model-parallelism/en/latest/pipelining.html), our [pipelining documentation specific to TensorFlow](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/tensorflow-user-guide/en/latest/perf_training.html?highlight=pipelining#pipelined-training), or complete [the TensorFlow 1 pipelining tutorial](../../tensorflow1/pipelining/README.md).

In this final part of the tutorial, we will pipeline our model over two stages. Start by making a copy of `completed_demos/completed_demo_replicated.py` from which to work. We will need to change the value of `num_replicas`, and create a variable for the number of gradient accumulation steps per replica:

```python
# Variables for model hyperparameters
num_classes = 10
input_shape = (28, 28, 1)
batch_size = 64
num_ipus = 2
num_replicas = num_ipus // 2
gradient_accumulation_steps_per_replica = 8
```

There are multiple ways to execute a pipeline, called _schedules_. The grouped and interleaved schedules are the most efficient because they execute stages in parallel, while the sequential schedule is mostly used for debugging. In this tutorial, we will use the grouped schedule, which is the default.

When using the grouped schedule, `gradient_accumulation_steps_per_replica` must be divisible by `(number of pipeline stages) * 2`. When using the interleaved schedule, `gradient_accumulation_steps_per_replica` must be divisible by `(number of pipeline stages)`. You can read more about the specifics of the different pipeline schedules in [the relevant section of the technical note on Model parallelism with TensorFlow](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/tf-model-parallelism/en/latest/pipelining.html#pipeline-scheduling).

If we use more than two IPUs, the model will be automatically replicated to fill up the requested number of IPUs. For example, if we select 8 IPUs for our 2-IPU model, four replicas of the model will be produced.

We also need to adjust `steps_per_execution` to be divisible by the total number of gradient accumulation steps across all replicas, so we make a slight change to the dataset-adjusting code:

```python
total_gradient_accumulation_steps = gradient_accumulation_steps_per_replica * num_replicas

# Adjust dataset lengths to be divisible by the batch size
train_data_len = x_train.shape[0]
train_steps_per_execution = train_data_len // (batch_size * num_replicas)
# `steps_per_execution` needs to be divisible by `total_gradient_accumulation_steps`
train_steps_per_execution = make_divisible(train_steps_per_execution, total_gradient_accumulation_steps)
train_data_len = make_divisible(train_data_len, train_steps_per_execution * batch_size)
x_train, y_train = x_train[:train_data_len], y_train[:train_data_len]

test_data_len = x_test.shape[0]
test_steps_per_execution = test_data_len // (batch_size * num_replicas)
# `steps_per_execution` needs to be divisible by `total_gradient_accumulation_steps`
test_steps_per_execution = make_divisible(test_steps_per_execution, total_gradient_accumulation_steps)
test_data_len = make_divisible(test_data_len, test_steps_per_execution * batch_size)
x_test, y_test = x_test[:test_data_len], y_test[:test_data_len]
```


When defining a model using the Keras Functional API, we control what parts of the model go into which stages with the `PipelineStage` context manager. Replace the model implementation in `mnist_cpu.py` with:

```python
def model_fn():
    # Input layer - "entry point" / "source vertex".
    input_layer = keras.Input(shape=input_shape)

    # Add graph nodes for the first pipeline stage.
    with ipu.keras.PipelineStage(0):
        x = keras.layers.Conv2D(32, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation="relu")(input_layer)
        x = keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2))(x)
        x = keras.layers.Conv2D(64, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation="relu")(x)

    # Add graph nodes for the second pipeline stage.
    with ipu.keras.PipelineStage(1):
        x = keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2))(x)
        x = keras.layers.Flatten()(x)
        x = keras.layers.Dropout(0.5)(x)
        x = keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation="softmax")(x)

    return input_layer, x
```

Any operations created inside a `PipelineStage(x)` context manager will be placed in the `x`th pipeline stage (where the stages are numbered starting from 0). Here, the model has been divided into two pipeline stages that run concurrently.

If you define your model using the Keras Sequential API, you can use the model's `set_pipeline_stage_assignment` method to assign pipeline stages to layers.

Now all we need to do is configure the pipelining-specific aspects of our model. Add the following line just before the first call to `model.compile()`:

```python
model.set_pipelining_options(
    gradient_accumulation_steps_per_replica=gradient_accumulation_steps_per_replica,
    pipeline_schedule=ipu.ops.pipelining_ops.PipelineSchedule.Grouped
)
```

Within the scope of an `IPUStrategy`, IPU-specific methods such as `set_pipelining_options` are dynamically added to the base `keras.Model` class, which allows us to configure IPU-specific aspects of the model. We could use the interleaved schedule here by changing `Grouped` to `Interleaved`.

The file `completed_demos/completed_demo_pipelining.py` shows what the code looks like after the above changes are made. If your code for the pipelined model is not working, you may find it useful to compare your code to that in `completed_demos/completed_demo_pipelining.py`.
