# Spell x Graphcore IPU Integration Tutorials and Examples 

This repository contains tutorials and examples to help you learn how to use Graphcore IPUs on the Spell Platform. This feature is currently in limited preview. 

If you are interested in finding out more about Graphcore, including getting preview access to IPUs to run these examples, please register
your interest [here](https://www.graphcore.ai/product_info).

If you are actively using this repository and want to report any issues, please reach out to Spell support at support@spell.ml.

The latest version of the documentation for the Poplar software stack, and other developer resources, is available at https://www.graphcore.ai/developer.

>  The code presented here uses Poplar SDK 2.4 in the default IPU-compatible container image during `spell run`. The Spell team will continue to update and support newer SDKs as they are released. 

### Tutorials

The [tutorials/](tutorials) folder contains simple tutorials to help you get started using the Poplar SDK and Graphcore tools in Spell.

* [tutorials/pytorch](tutorials/pytorch) - A set of tutorials to introduce the PyTorch framework support for the IPU.
* [tutorials/tensorflow2](tutorials/tensorflow2) - A set of tutorials to introduce the Tensorflow framework support for the IPU.
* [tutorials/poplar](tutorials/poplar) - A set of tutorials to introduce the low level C++ Poplar library for programming on the IPU.

For general IPU tutorials, please refer to the [Graphcore Github Tutorials repository](https://github.com/graphcore/tutorials). 

### Applications
Graphcore releases sample applications and code examples published in [Graphcore performance results](https://www.graphcore.ai/performance-results). 
This limited preview of Graphcore IPUs on Spell supports a smaller list from the [Graphcore Github Examples repository](https://github.com/graphcore/examples).

Read the [Applications README](README-Apps.md) to know more about how to run IPU application examples and for the list of supported models in Spell.

* For the rest of the IPU examples, please refer to the [Graphcore Examples](https://github.com/graphcore/examples) repository.
